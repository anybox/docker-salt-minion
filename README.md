# Docker image for salt-minion based on Debian

**not intended for production use**

This is a very simple image to have `salt-minion` run in a Docker container.

It uses the official Saltstack repositories for Debian, in order to install
the wished version rather than the one provided by Debian.

It exposes the whole `/etc/salt` as a volume, so that you can control the
whole configuration (including `minion_id`), preseed keys, etc (à la Salt Cloud)

It brings systemd to manage units on the host machine, this will require to
give some privileged to the container and map dbus directory (``/var/run/dbus``)

Please simply read `Dockerfile` for this version specifics.
The branch name is intended to be the major Salt release, although obviously
more branches can exist.
